## 🛠️ Installation


### Python environment

```bash
conda create -n sdar python==3.12 -y
conda activate sdar

pip3 install vllm==0.11.0

pip3 install flash-attn==2.7.4.post1 --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir
pip install -e .
```

The ICLR experiment launchers log to SwanLab through
`trainer.logger=['console','swanlab']`.

### Install Supported Environments

#### 1. ALFWorld
Install with pip:
```bash
pip3 install gymnasium==0.29.1
pip3 install stable-baselines3==2.6.0
pip3 install alfworld
```

Download PDDL & Game files and pre-trained MaskRCNN detector (will be stored in `~/.cache/alfworld/`):
```bash
alfworld-download -f
```

#### 2. WebShop
WebShop requires Python <=3.10, so begin by creating a new environment:
```bash
conda create -n verl-webshop python==3.10 -y
conda activate verl-webshop
```

Install WebShop:
```bash
cd ./agent_system/environments/env_package/webshop/webshop
./setup.sh -d all
```

After WebShop is installed, return to the root directory and install the verl package:
```bash
cd repo_root/
pip3 install torch==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
pip3 install flash-attn==2.7.4.post1 --no-build-isolation
pip3 install -e .
pip3 install vllm==0.8.2
# spacy 3.7.2 requires typer<0.10.0,>=0.3.0, but you have typer 0.15.2 which is incompatible.
# weasel 0.3.4 requires typer<0.10.0,>=0.3.0, but you have typer 0.15.2 which is incompatible.
```
The warnings can be safely ignored.

### Training

The `exp/iclr` branch exposes six standalone, paper-facing launchers:

```bash
bash examples/sdar_trainer_1.5b/run_alfworld.sh
bash examples/sdar_trainer_3b/run_webshop.sh
bash examples/sdar_trainer_7b/run_alfworld.sh
```

The matrix covers Qwen2.5 1.5B, 3B, and 7B on ALFWorld and WebShop.
All launchers use the canonical fairness protocol and the shared ICLR training
contract documented in `examples/README.md`.
### Merge checkpoints

See `scripts/model_merger.py` for FSDP/Megatron merge examples using paths under `./checkpoints/...`.
